# Accident-detection-using-Yolo

Working
We take the input video from a source and divide the video into several frames. Now these frames are converted into black and white. On each frame a car is detected using YOLO.

Now we write the code to draw rectangles on the detected cars. We check the distances between each detected car on the frame from each other. If the distance between the two cars is less than a particular value and the rectangle boxes of any two cars intersect each other then we colour the box red display the message that Crash has been detected.

All of the above process happens for a single frame. Now all of this is set in a loop for each frame of the video and Vehicle crash is detected.

Alert Generation
If the car crash is detected in 20 frames of a video simultaneously then an alert is generated by sending an email to the required person. That email also contains the photo of the car crash that was detected.
